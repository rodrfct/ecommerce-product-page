## My process

### Built with

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - JS Toolkit
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) - Vue framework
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - Vue Store
- TypeScript
- CSS Nesting



### What I learned

I made a lightbox for the first time, at first I wasn't sure about how to make it, but it was pretty easy and made me realize that I've learned a lot since my first challenge.  
Also I became much faster and more efficient when writing CSS and I think my code did too!

My main goal with this challenge is to get used to Nuxt so I will continue developing it to make it a real full-stack app with more products.
